# About Autocaster

This script is for sequential, seamless, looped playback of Youtube or any other web-hosted videos parsed and fetched from any amount of user selected channels, including RSS sources.

Autocaster will remember played videos and won't repeat itself.

User can select how old/recent videos should be. Filtering by video title is also available.

Currently supported platforms: Windows, Linux.

This is a very early stage of development. Features to be added:
 * A proper configurator with UI
 * Support for Android and Mac
 * Text-to-speech and/or audio playback with images with generic animation (for enriching textual content to play in 'TV emulation' scenario)
